## About the project

This study examines macroevolutionary patterns linking frugivorous diets and carotenoid-dependent plumage coloration in passerine birds. By integrating trait data, phylogenetic models, and comparative methods, the work explores whether fruit-eating behavior is evolutionarily associated with vivid coloration due to the dietary acquisition of carotenoids.

## How to run the analyses

Scripts are organized in the `scripts/` folder by analysis type.  
To reproduce the results:

1. **R scripts** for data cleaning and figures are located in `scripts/`.
2. **RevBayes** analyses can be run using the provided `.Rev` scripts.
3. **BayesTraits** input/output files are also included.
4. SSE model comparisons are provided in the relevant subfolders.
